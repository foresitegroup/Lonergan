          With the support of Marquette University the Bernard Lonergan Archive is a digital repository of primary materials related to the work of Jesuit philosopher/theologian Bernard Lonergan: archival papers and audio recordings of lectures.<br>
          <br>
          Fr. Bernard Lonergan, S.J. was a Canadian Jesuit Priest born in Buckingham, Quebec. He was a philosopher-theologian, an economist, and a student of methodology. He taught at Loyola College (Montreal) (now part of Concordia University), Regis College (Toronto), the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Harvard University, and Boston College.<br>
          <br>
          He is the author of <em>Insight: A Study of Human Understanding</em> (1957) and <em>Method in Theology</em> (1972).  In <em>Insight</em> he worked out what he called a Generalized Empirical Method, and in <em>Method in Theology</em> he showed how this method elucidated the structure and process of work in theology.<br>

          Frederick Crowe began collecting what would become Lonergan's archival materials in 1953 and continued for many years. <a href="http://www.lonerganresource.com/frederick-crowe.php" target="new">More about Frederick Crowe</a><br>
